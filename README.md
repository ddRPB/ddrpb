## Radiotherapy clinical research IT infrastructure

RadiationDosePlan- Image/Biomarker-Outcome-platform (RPB) is a collection of open source software systems integrated via portal to deliver a core software infrastructure necessary to support the operation of non-commercial trials unit.

The RPB platform is a web-based solution which supports collection and exchange of radiotherapy specific research data in large scale multi-centre clinical and pre-clinical studies. It delivers a study management and electronic data capture system with special extensions dedicated to secure upload of medical imaging and treatment plans in DICOM format. These tools allow the trial personnel to handle multi-modal data conduction activities that yield to finalised patient cohort datasets.

## Platform features

* Managing multi-centre clinical trials
* Patient identity management and pseudonymisation
* Study subject randomisation (permuted block + strata)
* Electronic case report forms (eCRFs) for clinical data collection
* Patient reported outcomes (ePRO)
* Linked medical imaging (DICOM) and treatment plans (DICOM-RT)
* DICOM data de-identification and RTSTRUCT ROI naming harmonisation
* DICOM viewer with DICOM-RT plugin
* WebDAV access to DICOM data collected in particular project
* Storage for laboratory assays and other tabulated data

## Acknowledgment

For people who do use the RPB software platform as managed or self-operated solution supporting the conduction of their trials, when it is possible, we would appreciate your acknowledgement in publications and citation of the relevant papers:

* "This work was conducted in part using the RadPlanBio software platform."
