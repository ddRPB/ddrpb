RadiationDosePlan- Image/Biomarker-Outcome-platform (RPB) is a collection of open source software systems, namely electronic data capture system (EDC - OpenClinica), medical image archive (PACS - Conquest) and patient identity management system (PIDG - Mainzelliste), which are integrated in order to deliver a core software infrastructure necessary to support translational radiotherapy research projects. It provides fundamental data management features for efficient conduction of multi-centre clinical studies. RPB alone represents integration engine that handles communication between the core components but also extends the platform about new features. RPB can be used to:
* Manage trials with simple Clinical Trial Management System (CTMS)
* Pseudonymise patients participating in multi-centre clinical trial
* Randomise patients in randomised trials
* Track patient participation across multiple studies
* Collect medical imaging and treatment plans in DICOM format
* Handles DICOM data de-identification and harmonisation
* Enable patient reported outcomes (ePRO) and clinician outcome assessment (eCOA) data collection
