                    Proposal: Radiotherapy is a mainstay of modern oncology. During the last years, multiparametric imagebased treatment planning, monitoring,
                    and follow-up has become standard of care in curatively intended radiation oncology. This provides a host of dose-space/volume-time
                    resoluted data of individual patients which, if integrated with detailed clinical baseline and outcome data, is a powerful research tool
                    to evaluate dose-space/volume-time responses in tumors and normal tissues. This is the basis to generate novel predictive multiparameter models for
                    tumor-controlprobability (TCP) and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP). These predictive models can be translated into innovative studies on
                    personalized radiotherapy, e.g. for biologically based inhomogeneous dose distributions which may reduce treatment sequelae or increase the chance to
                    locally control tumors.

                        />
                        The data also are essential for comparative analysis of different treatment approaches, e.g. particles vs. photons or different
                    treatment combinations.Furthermore, if linked to investigations of tissues originating from the same patients, these data may provide a backbone for
                    identification and validation of biomarkers for radiation oncology. Such infrastructure is also necessary for rapid online medical quality assurance,
                    including checks for consistent contouring, dose planning and protocol adherence in prospective radiotherapy trials and for linking DKTK research with
                    similar efforts by international partners. To be successful this research requires a radiotherapy-specific large-scale, systematic and sustainable IT infrastructure.
                    This infrastructure is currently not available in Germany, and it has been requested by the International Review Board that such an infrastructure has to be
                    established with high priority in the radiation oncology program of the DKTK. Therefore, under consideration of the German medico-legal requirements,
                    a RadPlanBio-Platform will be established across the DKTK partner sites and beyond. As an internationally unique feature, the RadPlanBio-Platform will also
                    incorporate preclinical data from experimental radiotherapy studies on animals. The RadPlanBio-Platform will be linked to the clinical communication platform
                    and to international partner initiatives.
